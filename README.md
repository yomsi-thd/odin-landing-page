Intially, this was an exercise from the Odin Project.

However, as development grows, the focus eventually shifted toward
something more personal. Before the Odin Project, I study Japanese
on the side. Thus, I decided to create a landing page of a private
discord server I'm in - the 天 Japanese learning Discord. 

The idea is to develop something I enjoy & want to invest my time
on instead of doing the bare minimum and call it a day.

In the future, I will ocassionally come back to this project when 
I get better at HTML/CSS along w/ extra Javascript funcionalities.

Really enjoyed doing it.
