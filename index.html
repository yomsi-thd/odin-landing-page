                    <p>Some days I'm on Discord while saving people off burning buildings. Other days I have seggs w/ 20 women. I personally deleted Anki to spend more time w/ others & gym. Not everyone gets it, and that‚Äôs cool.  </p>

                    <p>"I don‚Äôt just watch anime‚ÄîI mine it. Every 'yatta!', every senpai whisper, every mid-battle scream? Flashcard fodder. My Anki decks cover slang, honorifics, dialects, kanji, OPs/EDs, and pitch accents‚Äîwith actual anime audio embedded. I loop scenes, dissect grammar like it‚Äôs DNA, and crush daily reviews before breakfast. Retention? 98.2%. Japanese isn‚Äôt just a language. It‚Äôs my questline. Anki is my waifu, my oxygen tank, my save point. That‚Äôs fluency. That‚Äôs endgame."</p>

                    <p>AZKi isn‚Äôt just a VTuber‚Äîshe‚Äôs the soundtrack to my soul." Her voice? Otherworldly. One karaoke stream and I was hooked. Now my Anki decks are packed with her lyrics and clips. My room‚Äôs a shrine, my dreams hum in pastel harmonies. She‚Äôs not just my oshi‚Äîshe‚Äôs my muse, my serotonin generator, my vibe core. I will kill anyone who insults my oshi.</p>
