                    <p>Some days I'm on Discord while saving people off burning buildings. Other days I have seggs w/ 20 women. I personally deleted Anki to spend more time w/ others & gym. Not everyone gets it, and that’s cool.  </p>

                    <p>I don’t just watch anime—I mine it. Every line, every ‘yatta!’ and ‘urusai!’ becomes a potential flashcard. I’ve got an Anki deck for casual speech, honorifics, rare kanji, and the sacred OPs and EDs. When the characters scream mid-battle? Yup—Cloze deletion city.
                        I watch with Japanese subs first, then no subs, then rewatch with pausing like I’m dissecting the genome of Japanese grammar. That one scene where the senpai confesses in a soft whisper? I loop it. That weird dialect from the countryside episode? Added to my 'regional quirk deck.'
                
                        I hit my daily reviews before breakfast. I’ve got frequency-based sentence decks, pitch-accent guides embedded, and custom audio notes from actual anime clips. Retention rate? 98.2%. My backlog of unsuspended cards? A shrine to future fluency.
                
                        Japanese isn’t just a language. It’s my character arc. My Anki isn’t just a tool—it's my oxygen tank, my waifu, my creed. That’s the dream. That’s the endgame.</p>

                    <p>AZKi isn’t just a VTuber—she’s the soundtrack to my soul." Her voice? Otherworldly. One karaoke stream and I was hooked. Now my Anki decks are packed with her lyrics and clips. My room’s a shrine, my dreams hum in pastel harmonies. She’s not just my oshi—she’s my muse, my serotonin generator, my vibe core. I will kill anyone who insults my oshi.</p>
