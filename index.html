                <p>"They told me my media tastes were deranged. I took that as a compliment."
                    I live at the crossroads of madness and masterpiece—where Skibidi toilets ascend to godhood and Rance pulverizes moral ambiguity with a demon-slaying smirk. To some, it’s noise and controversy. To me, it’s art—unfiltered, relentless, absurd, and alive.
                    People ask me why I watch this stuff. I don't watch it—I experience it. It's not a guilty pleasure. It's a proud one. Skibidi speaks to my chaotic soul. Rance reminds me that fiction can be fearless. I'm not here for comfort—I’m here for the ride.</p>

                <p>I don’t just watch anime—I mine it. Every line, every ‘yatta!’ and ‘urusai!’ becomes a potential flashcard. I’ve got an Anki deck for casual speech, honorifics, rare kanji, and the sacred OPs and EDs. When the characters scream mid-battle? Yup—Cloze deletion city.
                    I watch with Japanese subs first, then no subs, then rewatch with pausing like I’m dissecting the genome of Japanese grammar. That one scene where the senpai confesses in a soft whisper? I loop it. That weird dialect from the countryside episode? Added to my 'regional quirk deck.'
                
                    I hit my daily reviews before breakfast. I’ve got frequency-based sentence decks, pitch-accent guides embedded, and custom audio notes from actual anime clips. Retention rate? 98.2%. My backlog of unsuspended cards? A shrine to future fluency.
                
                    Japanese isn’t just a language. It’s my character arc. My Anki isn’t just a tool—it's my oxygen tank, my waifu, my creed. That’s the dream. That’s the endgame.</p>

                <p>“She’s not just a VTuber. AZKi is my galaxy.”
                    Ever since I stumbled into one of her karaoke streams, my life’s been divided into Before AZKi and After AZKi. The first note she sang felt like it reached parts of my soul I didn’t even know existed. That silky tone, that effortless vocal control—it’s not human. It’s divine.My Anki decks? Filled with AZKi lyrics and voice clips. My wall? Poster central. My dreams? Always have a soft pink filter and background harmonies.
                    She’s not just my oshi. She’s my emotional battery pack, my aesthetic inspiration, my spirit animal. I want to be stepped on by her.</p>
